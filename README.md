# The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game

### Project Goals
The goal of the project is to create a console game called Rock - Paper - Scissors. It is a simple two player game where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors". 

The rules are as follows:

•	Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)

•	Scissors beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors)

•	Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)

The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g. "paper"), the game outcome is "draw".

### Algorithm
First we ask the player to make his/her move.Then the computer makes a random move.The winner is determined based on that information.

After that we print the score of the players so far and ask the player if he/she wants to play the game again.If the player chooses to play the game again,the game is restarted.Otherwise the game ends.
